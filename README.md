<h1>BudgeIt</h1>
<h3>Project Abstract</h3>
<p>The problem BudgeIt aims to tackle is the ambiguity of typical banking apps when it comes to tracking your financial goals. We intend to streamline the money management process by providing our users with a simple but powerful UI. After linking their bank account with Plaid, our app will provide the user with the most important information at a glance along with various options to dive deeper if they choose to do so. Additionally, it will make creating budgets and sticking to them as simple as possible. Upon completion, BudgeIt will give the user all the necessary resources to get their finances back in line and keep them there.</p>
<h3>Technical Details</h3>
<p>BudgeIt is an iOS app built with Swift 5 and SwiftUI. It utilizes Plaid to retrieve user bank information, and Firebase to handle backend operations.</p>
